This is a pure data library

Many abstractions and externals are just ports and modifications of existing
programs, primarily patches from the pure data help files.

Some external libraries are needed, primarily zexy and iemlib

Various pure pd abstractions are in the purepdnfun folder within the examples
folder, which also holds my tcl plugin file for Pd-extended.

I would have liked to release everything under a BSD license but don't

problematic .c files: exponential envelopes, buzz~, and the makefile

documentation for the sequencer is in manual/sequencerdoc.txt
there is a summary in manual/Overview.pd
