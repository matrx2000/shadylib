svosim~ (figure a good algorithm out)

This is a pure data library that I always add to whenever I want to either do
something myself or make something that hasn't been made in pd. 

to install just put this library in your search path and use [import shadylib]

Licensing: I would like to release everything under a BSD license but don't
think I can using externals that are licensed as GPL.
problematic .c files: exponential envelopes, buzz~, and makefile

documentation for the sequencer is in sequencerdoc.txt
