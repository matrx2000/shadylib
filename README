This is a pure data library that I always add to whenever I want to either do
something myself or make something that hasn't been made in pd. 

to install just put this library in your search path and use [import shadelib]

... can't believe I didn't think of a better name

Licensing: I would like to release everything under a BSD license but don't
think I can using externals that are licensed as GPL. Therefore everything that
uses externals licensed under GPL is GPL, and everything that only uses PD
vanilla or externals licensed under BSD is BSD.

documentation for the sequencer is in sequencerdoc.txt
