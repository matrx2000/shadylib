to build the externals, cd into “extern” folder and edit the makefile to reflect 
your system and setup. then type “make install”. There are fat OSX binaries in 
the extern/darwin folder though, simply move all of the .pd_darwin files into 
the main directory if you're on osx

these objects are being considered for consolidation, removal, or
to be coded as externals:
combfilter~ - combine with normcomb~ (with flag)
nrcombfilter~
svosim~ (figure a good algorithm out)

This is a pure data library that I always add to whenever I want to either do
something myself or make something that hasn't been made in pd. 

to install just put this library in your search path and use [import shadylib]

Licensing: I would like to release everything under a BSD license but don't
think I can using externals that are licensed as GPL. Therefore everything that
uses externals licensed under GPL is GPL, and everything that only uses PD
vanilla or externals licensed under BSD is BSD.
