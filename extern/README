numargs: simple (my 1st!) pd external to give the number of arguments of the
containing canvas.

tcheb~: this is a chebyshev waveshaper. I wanted a chebyshev waveshaper where
the order (n) could be modulated. There is linear interpolation for fractional
values of n.

delwritec~: delwrite~ with clear
delread~: delread~ clone
sampphase~: phasor~ that only changes frequency at phase reset optionally
tabread4hs~: tabread~ clone with hermite spline interpolation from nusmuk
(updated to new tabread4 onset inlet)
vdhs~: hermite spline interpolated delay tap

the delay reading objects can only be used with delwritec~ (can't use delwrite~)
and visa-versa

to make it you may (probably will) need to edit the makefile in this (the
numargs) folder to fit your system, I only have OSX at the moment.
