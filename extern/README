numargs: simple (my 1st!) pd external to give the number of arguments of the
containing canvas.

tcheb~: this is a chebyshev waveshaper. I wanted a chebyshev waveshaper where the order
(n)could be modulated. There is linear interpolation for fractional values of n.

to make it you may (probably will) need to edit the makefile in this (the
numargs) folder to fit your system, I only have OSX at the moment. check the
system and type the appropriate command (e.g. "make pd_darwin"). Alternatively
get the Pd library template and edit it. (it is GPL licensed and I'm releasing
this under the BSD license, didn't want them conflicting)
