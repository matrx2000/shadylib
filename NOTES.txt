todo: 
change all objects to dynamically create signal or control inlets/outlets
depending on arguments.

self-contained state saving! perhaps sssad-based

external:
bandlimited wavetables of arbitrary degree
(2d arrays and/or table-filling fft algorithm) that update as they are changed
(could have the fft executed sample-by sample in the case of frequency mod, what 
frequency and sample are we at, etc.)
figure out formant mode for wavetables? like massive
a better many that dynamically allocates voices a la supercollider.
system for dynamic inlets, outlets, subpatches, etc.
an external to get information about pd (like if it's running 32 or 64 bit).
repeater~ -> loop~-based?
change repeater into 2 seperate abstractions later? one for writing to the array
and one for reading it?
