todo: 
change all objects to dynamically create signal or control inlets/outlets
depending on arguments.

self-contained state saving! perhaps sssad-based

external:
bandlimited wavetables of arbitrary degree
(2d arrays and/or table-filling fft algorithm) that update as they are changed
(could have the fft executed sample-by sample in the case of frequency mod, what 
frequency and sample are we at, etc.)
figure out formant mode for wavetables? like massive
system for dynamic inlets, outlets, subpatches, etc.
change repeater into 2 seperate abstractions later? one for writing to the array
and one for reading it?
